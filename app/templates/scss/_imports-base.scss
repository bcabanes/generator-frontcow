/** Quarks
========================================================================== */
/*
 * Styles reserved for default HTML elements only. Default paragraphs, links, lists and micros. Style
 * guide stuff.
 */

/** Atoms
========================================================================== */
/*
 * CSS objects that can be extended from and into other elements of the site. Think of these as
 * the default relationships that can be used again and again without bloating the codebase.
 */

/** Molecules
========================================================================== */
/*
 * Sometimes we need one-off structures, such as a banner or navigation element or footer, that we
 * donâ€™t intend to replicate. This is where we can combine multiple quarks and atoms, without
 * interfering with any of our global styles.
 */

/** Organisms
========================================================================== */
/*
 * Organisms are made of many molecules combined together. This is a bigger part of design than molecules,
 * they possibly constitue the main goal of a template. The CSS rules here, has to be organism centric and
 * specific.
 */

/** Templates
========================================================================== */
/*
 * Templates are made of one or a multiple of organisms. Sometime you need to adjust one or many CSS rules
 * to finish the mockup or wireframe of the page. The CSS rules has to be verry light and must be out of
 * anyone organism scope.
 */

/** Pages
========================================================================== */
/*
 * Pages are the results of the Atomic Design process. This is the end process step and the CSS rules
 * MUST be out of the templates scope.
